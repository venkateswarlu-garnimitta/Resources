Summary\n","\n","### What We Accomplished\n","\n","This notebook delivered an end-to-end workflow for evaluating a Corporate Travel Policy Advisor with Flotorch Eval using the DeepEval contextual relevancy metric.\n","\n","### Workflow Summary\n","\n","1. **Configured Infrastructure**\n","   - Set up `FlotorchLLM` for answer generation.  \n","   - Connected to `FlotorchVectorStore` for travel-policy retrieval.  \n","   - Initialized `LLMEvaluator` with the DeepEval engine targeting contextual relevancy.  \n","\n","2. **Generated Responses**\n","   - Loaded travel ground-truth questions from `travel_policy_gt.json`.  \n","   - Retrieved relevant policy excerpts for each question.  \n","   - Generated answers with the inference LLM and captured gateway metadata (latency, cost, tokens).  \n","\n","3. **Evaluated Contextual Relevancy**\n","   - Ran DeepEval contextual relevancy scoring over every response.  \n","   - Verified whether the retrieved snippets stayed on-topic for the traveler’s request.  \n","   - Recorded contextual relevancy scores alongside gateway diagnostics for governance.  \n","\n","4. **Visualized Results**\n","   - Displayed per-question contextual relevancy scores in a reviewer-friendly table.  \n","   - Exported the full JSON payload for auditing or automation.  \n","\n","### Key Takeaways\n","\n","- **Context Relevancy = 1.0** signals all retrieved snippets were pertinent to the travel question; lower scores highlight noisy or off-policy passages.  \n","- DeepEval judges **Question & Answer ↔ Retrieved Context**, making it ideal for validating that booking, reimbursement, and safety guidance come from the right policy sections.  \n","- Monitoring contextual relevancy keeps the focus on retriever quality, helping finance and travel teams tighten documentation coverage before guidance reaches employees."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"venve","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
